ACS-3320 CSS Zen Garden Exercise

For this exercise, I took some seasonal inspiration and went with a ðŸ‘»sUpErðŸ‘»SpOoKyðŸ‘»GrAvEyArDðŸ‘» theme for the [CSS Zen Garden Challenge](https://www.csszengarden.com/).  The unmodified base CSS Zen Garden HTML was used, only the style sheet was modified to create this layout.

Selector types used:
 - \* wildcard selector
 - element selector
 - . class selector
 - \# id selector
 - \> child selector
 - [property selector]
 - :nth-of-type selector
 - :nth-last-of-type selector
 - :nth-child selector
 - ::before pseudoselector
